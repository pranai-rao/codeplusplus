            <p>
                We believe that middle and high school students should learn computer science and programming due to its immense relevance and benefits in today's digital age.
                Computer science education equips students with essential skills and knowledge that are increasingly valuable in various fields and industries. 
                By learning programming languages and concepts, students develop problem-solving abilities, logical thinking, and creativity. 
                These skills are transferable and empower students to tackle complex challenges in their academic and professional lives. 
                Additionally, computer science promotes critical thinking and analytical skills, 
                enabling students to better understand and navigate the rapidly evolving technological landscape. 
                Furthermore, computer science offers numerous career opportunities, as the demand for skilled professionals in this field continues to grow. 
                By introducing computer science education early on, 
                middle and high school students gain a solid foundation and a head start towards acquiring in-demand skills,
                fostering innovation, and shaping the future.
