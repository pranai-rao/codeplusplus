                            Maitreyi is an enthusiastic learner and teacher, with a growing passion for
                            teaching. She currently teaches mathematics to young students at the Greater Boston STEM
                            program and also tutors children at the educational
                            program <i>Kumon</i>. Additionally, she has completed internships in the fields
                            of Mechanical Engineering, Clinical Trials, Supply Chain, and IT department at the
                            biomedical company Transmedics Inc., which broadened her exposure to working in the
                            corporate field, and expanded her knowledge in computer science.
                            Throughout high school Maitreyi has taken many computer science courses and
                            learned Python, Java, and C++. Her goal is to introduce
                            more students into the STEM field through Code++.

                    <p>
                        Yuvan is an engaged and interactive teacher, eager to help make a change. 
                        He began his coding journey when a friend encouraged him to start learning, and since then, 
                        he has loved coding and learning all about it in his free time. 
                        Though his academic interests lie primarily in the fields of physics and astronomy, coding has seamlessly integrated into his pursuits. 
                        Currently, he attends Nashua High School South, where he pursues both his interests in astronomy and coding, 
                        in addition to his many extra-curriculars. In addition to teaching programming, Yuvan excitedly serves as a tutor 
                        in the English Language Arts and is ready to teach many more students in the years to come. 
                        He also practices taekwondo, mixed martial arts, playing piano, as well as managing his own clubs.
