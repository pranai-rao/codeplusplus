                        <h3>Java [Coming later . . .]</h3>
                        <p>
                            Java is a powerful and widely-used programming language that is highly regarded for its
                            versatility, portability, and robustness. It is an object-oriented language,
                            meaning it focuses on creating reusable code components called objects.<br><br>
                            Java's syntax is similar to other popular programming languages like C++ and C#,
                            making it easier for students to transition between these languages.
                            Its straightforward and structured syntax emphasizes clarity and readability,
                            promoting good coding practices.<br><br>Overall, Java is an excellent language for students
                            starting their programming journey. Its versatility, platform independence,
                            object-oriented nature, and strong community support make it a valuable skill to acquire.
                            Learning Java equips students with the fundamentals of programming and prepares them for a
                            wide range of software development opportunities.

                        <h3>Web Development (HTML + CSS + JS) [Coming later . . .]</h3>
                        <p>
                            HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and JS (JavaScript)
                            are three essential languages used in web development. They work together to create and
                            style web pages, as well as provide interactivity and functionality.<br><br>
                            HTML is the foundation of web pages. It is a markup language used to structure the content
                            and define the elements of a webpage. With HTML, you can create headings, paragraphs,
                            images, links, tables, forms, and more. It uses tags to mark up different parts of a
                            webpage, providing a hierarchical structure that browsers can interpret and display.
                            <br><br>CSS is used to style HTML elements and make web pages visually appealing.
                            It separates the presentation (styling) from the structure (HTML). CSS allows you to
                            specify colors, fonts, layouts, and other visual properties of HTML elements. It uses
                            selectors to target specific elements and applies rules to define their appearance. With
                            CSS, you can create responsive designs, adjust layouts for different screen sizes, and
                            enhance the user experience.<br><br>JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity
                            and functionality to web pages. It allows you to manipulate and modify HTML and CSS
                            dynamically. With JavaScript, you can respond to user actions, validate forms, create
                            animations, and build interactive features like image sliders, dropdown menus, and more.
                            JavaScript is also commonly used for client-side web development, meaning the code runs
                            directly in the user's browser. When used together, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript enable the
                            creation of dynamic and engaging web pages. HTML provides the structure and content, CSS
                            enhances the presentation and styling, and JavaScript adds interactivity and functionality.
                            Learning these languages provides a solid foundation for web development. They are
                            relatively easy to learn and widely supported across browsers. As you progress, you will
                            discover frameworks and libraries that build upon these languages, such as Bootstrap for
                            CSS or React for JavaScript, which further expand your capabilities and simplify complex
                            tasks. With HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, students can create their own web pages,
                            customize existing designs, and gain the skills needed to pursue careers in web
                            development, design, or related fields.
